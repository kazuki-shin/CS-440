    Minigratch Gradient Descent Function to train model
    1. Format the data
    2. call four_nn function to obtain losses
    3. Return all the weights/biases and a list of losses at each epoch
    Args:
        epoch (int) - number of iterations to run through neural net
        w1, w2, w3, w4, b1, b2, b3, b4 (numpy arrays) - starting weights
        x_train (np array) - (n,d) numpy array where d=number of features
        y_train (np array) - (n,) all the labels corresponding to x_train
        num_classes (int) - number of classes (range of y_train)
        shuffle (bool) - shuffle data at each epoch if True. Turn this off for testing.
    Returns:
        w1, w2, w3, w4, b1, b2, b3, b4 (numpy arrays) - resulting weights
        losses (list of ints) - each index should correspond to epoch number
            Note that len(losses) == epoch
    Hints:
        Should work for any number of features and classes
        Good idea to print the epoch number at each iteration for sanity checks!
        (Stdout print will not affect autograder as long as runtime is within limits)

    Use the trained weights & biases to see how well the nn performs

        y_test (np array) - (n',) all the labels corresponding to x_test

        class_rate_per_class (list of floats) - Classification Rate per class
            (index corresponding to class number)

        Good place to show your confusion matrix as well.
        The confusion matrix won't be autograded but necessary in report.
